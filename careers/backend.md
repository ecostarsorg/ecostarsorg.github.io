## About Ecostars 
Born in 2021, [Ecostars](https://ecostars.org) is a B2B SaaS: a hotel sustainability certification that responds to the sustainable travel trend by awarding eco-stars through a registered algorithm that calculates the environmental impact per stay of each hotel based on three basic parameters: energy efficiency, water efficiency, and sustainable commitments (CO2, circular economy, sustainable food, social impact and animal welfare). The evaluation process is simple, free of charge, automated and statistical -based on an algorithm and comparative benchmark tables-, globally scalable, objective, unbiased and comprehensive, plus 95%+ faster than any other in the market.

In just one year, Ecostars has become the #1 ESG certificate in Spain and #3 globally, present in 30+ countries across Europe, Latin America and Africa. More than 1,500 hotels, including large chains as H10, Meliá, Catalonia, Eurostars, Abba or Ilunion have been certified.

Our team has extensive experience in building great products and companies. We know success, we know failure; we have built platforms from scratch, we have dealt with large legacy systems. We genuinely care about each team member and the products and services we bring to life. 

As a purpose-driven and lean team, we passionately embrace:
- Transparency and trust
- Flat organization
- Diverse team
- Collaborative culture: your opinion counts
- Lean and customer-centric
- Innovative environment
- Flexibility and async work
- Professional growth

## Within the first 3 months, you will:
- Take ownership defining and implementing new functionalities
- Improve the process to how we code, review, and ship to improve quality all around

## Within the first 6 months, you will:
- Become the most knowledgeable person on multiple key features

## How we work
*Steering committee* (steerco)
Once per week we hold a company-wide meeting where we sync about our ongoing projects, needs and thoughts. Everybody is welcome and decisions are made (mostly) by consensus. We intend to keep doing this as long as it is manageable, because we believe it is the best way to avoid confusion and noise.

*Rhythm: Lean Software Development*
We work in very short cycles, where work takes as long as it takes, but we try to simplify every iteration, release early, test and learn.

*What about epics/longer projects?*
Kickoff summary during the steerco so we are all on the same page
Heartbeats: after every “packet” of work, you summarize what is done and we agree on 

*Asynchronous*
You should collaborate as though most things you ask of others will get an answer eventually, but not necessarily right this second. Your first choice of action should be to post a message, a todo, or a document about what you need to explain or need to know. Then others can read it on their schedule, when the natural lulls of the day allow it, rather than being interrupted right in their peak flow time
- No dailies
- Focus and quality time to work
- Synchronous meetings: there will be times when you do need to tightly collaborate with someone in real time, but those cases should be infrequent. We have pings, video calls, screen-sharing, or even in-person collaboration for when async isn’t efficient.


*Ownership and proactivity: managers of one*
Setting your own direction when one isn’t detailed; determining what needs to be done, and doing it, without waiting for someone to tell you to.

*Communication*
Since we work asynchronously and remotely, it’s important to radiate information about what we’re working on. We use slack channels profusely.
What will you be working on this week? Write a message to your future self last thing on Friday with the priorities for the week and share it with the team. This way you’ll have all the context once you get back from the weekend or holiday

*Balance*
We believe in the value of a balanced life, which is why we maintain a 40-hour work week. Keeping working hours reasonable helps us focus on what truly matters and ensures that our time and energy are spent effectively. Rest, good sleep, and a fulfilling life outside of work are essential for long-term success and well-being.

Occasionally, off-hours work may be required for on-call duties, maintenance, or emergencies. However, these instances should not extend your total working hours. We trust you to take the necessary time off to recover and balance any extra efforts during the week.
