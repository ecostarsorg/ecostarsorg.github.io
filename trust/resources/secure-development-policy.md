# Secure Development Policy
* **Version**: v1.1
* **Date of version**: 2024-04
* **Author**: Information Security Officer
* **Approver**: CTO

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
This document establishes the security guidelines and best practices for software development at Ecostars ESG AI. The objective is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of applications by embedding security into the development lifecycle.

### 1.2 Scope
This policy applies to all developers, engineers, and personnel involved in the software development process, covering:
- Secure coding practices
- Software security updates
- Testing and release protocols
- Environment management (production, staging, development)
- CI/CD pipeline security
- Architectural design and reliability

## 2. Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
### 2.1 Secure Coding Practices
- Follow industry best practices such as OWASP Top 10 and SANS CWE.
- Use secure frameworks and libraries with maintained updates.
- Prohibit hardcoded credentials and enforce environment variable-based secrets management.
- Conduct peer code reviews focusing on security vulnerabilities.

### 2.2 Software Security Updates
- Regularly update third-party dependencies and libraries to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Apply security patches promptly following a defined patching schedule.
- Monitor for new CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and implement mitigations.
- Maintain a process for emergency hotfixes in the event of critical vulnerabilities.

## 3. Testing and Release Protocols
### 3.1 Testing Requirements
- Automated static (SAST) and dynamic (DAST) security testing must be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Penetration testing must be performed periodically and before major releases.
- Functional and security regression tests must be conducted before deployments.
- We maintain unit tests for our code, ensuring at least 95% line coverage in core services that handle data integrity.

### 3.2 Release Management
- Implement a controlled release strategy with staged rollouts.
- Use feature flags to deploy new functionalities safely.
- Maintain rollback plans for every release in case of failure.
- Document changes and security improvements in release notes.
- We release new features to production only when they pass the testing protocol.
- Major releases are deployed late at night to minimize the impact on live usage.
- Our deployment system includes an easy rollback mechanism at a low level, allowing us to revert changes reliably even in cases of third-party dependency failures or OS upgrades.
- We utilize a reproducible build system (based on NixOS reproducible builds) that allows us to spin up a full copy of our environment in a different data center or provider in case of a catastrophic failure.

## 4. Environment Management
### 4.1 Development, Staging, and Production Environments
- Isolate production, staging, and development environments.
- Use separate access control policies for each environment.
- Do not use real customer data in non-production environments.
- Ensure logging and monitoring are enabled in all environments.

### 4.2 Access Controls
- Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for system access.
- Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for accessing production systems.
- Audit and review access permissions regularly.

## 5. CI/CD Pipeline Security
### 5.1 Secure CI/CD Processes
- Require code reviews and security checks before merging code.
- Automate security scans for dependencies, code, and infrastructure.
- Store CI/CD secrets securely, avoiding hardcoded credentials.
- Ensure least privilege principles for CI/CD tooling access.
- Our CI processes enhance code quality and accelerate deployment times.

### 5.2 Deployment Security
- Ensure deployments are logged and monitored.
- Scan container images and infrastructure as code (IaC) for vulnerabilities.
- Restrict direct production deployments; enforce approval processes.

## 6. Architectural Design and Reliability
### 6.1 Software Design Principles
- We prioritize building simple, reliable software.
- Our software follows the ## Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)** architecture to improve debugging and prevent unintended side effects.
- Our backend architecture consists of well-delimited services, each of which can be independently scaled.
- When a service queries another, it does so in a fault-tolerant manner, ensuring that failures in non-critical services (e.g., email) do not affect core platform functionality.
- Our system is built with stable, well-defined API components, making debugging and maintenance efficient.
- Our main database uses a ## bitemporal architecture** (similar to SQL:2011 standards), ensuring that backups contain all historical data at any given point in time.

### 6.2 Code Quality and Testing
- All software undergoes code review before deployment.
- Reviews are conducted by either the CTO or a senior engineering team member.
- New features go through a QA cycle before deployment, with more extensive regression testing for larger changes.

## 7. Compliance and Review
### 7.1 Compliance Standards
- Adhere to SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, and other relevant security frameworks.
- Ensure all software meets regulatory and contractual security requirements.

### 7.2 Policy Review and Updates
- This policy is reviewed and updated at least annually.
- Security training is required for developers to stay up to date on best practices.

## 8. Conclusion
By following this Secure Development Policy, Ecostars ESG AI ensures the security and reliability of its software products. Security is a shared responsibility, and all employees must adhere to these principles to protect company and customer data.
