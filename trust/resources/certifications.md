# Certifications
Ecostars is working on getting certified regarding data and process security. Specifically, we are working to obtain the **SOC-2** and **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** security certifications. 
We already follow guidelines and recommendations in the architecture and development of the platform (most importantly **OWASP** recommendations and multi-tenant architecture), which should simplify the certification process. 

Finally, our Engineering team has gone through the process of getting certified before, and we are confident that their level of excellence and quality will result in a valid certification for Ecostars very soon. 

While not certified as SOC analysts, our support staff is trained periodically on potential security issues. The staff monitors platform access with the support of our Data Analytics and Engineering departments. Access control is monitored and alarms are raised for strange patterns. 

## Certifications and other compliance reports from SaaS 
While Ecostars is a young company and still in the process of getting certified, we work with top of the line providers that have already undergone extensive testing.
