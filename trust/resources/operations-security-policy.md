## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
This document establishes the operational security guidelines and practices at Ecostars ESG AI. The goal is to ensure the integrity, availability, and security of all production systems, environments, and services.

### 1.2 Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and stakeholders responsible for operating, maintaining, and securing company infrastructure, including:
- Development, staging, and production environments
- Access control and authentication
- Monitoring, logging, and incident response
- Service reliability and availability

## 2. Environment Management
### 2.1 Development Environment
- The development environment is local to tech team members and exists on their individual machines.
- It is used exclusively by the tech team for building, testing, and refining new features.
- No real customer data is used in the development environment.
- Developers are encouraged to follow security best practices, such as using secure dependencies and scanning for vulnerabilities.

### 2.2 Staging Environment
- The staging environment is used to integrate features and conduct end-to-end testing.
- It is accessible only to the product, tech, and QA teams.
- The environment may be unstable during testing, and crashes or bugs are expected.
- It mimics production in architecture and configuration but does not use real customer data.

### 2.3 Production Environment
- The production environment is the live, customer-facing system.
- It is strictly maintained for stability, ensuring an uninterrupted user experience.
- No testing or development is conducted in production.
- All features deployed have passed rigorous testing in the staging environment.
- Only authorized personnel have access to production systems.

## 3. Access Control and Authentication
- Access to production systems is restricted based on Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for all privileged accounts.
- Access to environments is reviewed periodically to ensure compliance with security policies.

## 4. Monitoring and Logging
- Continuous monitoring is in place for all environments to detect anomalies.
- Logs are securely stored and reviewed regularly to identify potential security risks.
- Automated alerts notify relevant teams of suspicious activities or system failures.

## 5. Service Reliability and Availability
- The architecture is designed for high availability and fault tolerance.
- Services are independently scalable to handle workload variations.
- If a service dependency fails (e.g., email service), the platform continues to function, ensuring minimal disruption.
- We utilize world-class providers for servers, transactional emails, and databases, currently hosted on Azure.
- Vendor-agnostic architecture allows for migration to another provider (e.g., AWS) if necessary.

## 6. Backup and Disaster Recovery
- Regular backups of production data are performed and securely stored.
- Backups are encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Disaster recovery plans include reproducible build systems, allowing rapid deployment in a different data center if needed.

## 7. Compliance and Review
- This policy aligns with SOC 2, ISO 27001, and GDPR standards.
- Regular security audits and penetration testing are conducted.
- The policy is reviewed and updated annually or after major incidents.

## 8. Conclusion**
Operational security is critical to the reliability and trustworthiness of Ecostars ESG AI. By adhering to these guidelines, we ensure the security, stability, and compliance of our production systems.
